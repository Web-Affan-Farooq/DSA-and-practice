## Time complexity :
## Big O notation:
Big o notation means the time required for the executaion of program when the input size increases 

## O(n) notation:
O(n) notation means the required time for the execution of program will increases **linearly** with the proportion to the size of input
eg. : As the number of items in the input data increases , the time it takes for the algorithm to run increases correspondingly .

Tip : 1 or more loop in the function

## O(1) notation :
O(1) means that the overall time required for the execution of program will be constant no matter how large is the input size .

## O(n^2) notation :
O(n^2) notation means that the execution time will increase qudratically (double execuation time) when the size of input increases .
Tip : nested loops in the function
